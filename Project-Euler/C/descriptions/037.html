        <!-- Problem Description -->
        <div class="description">
            <p>The number of 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to
            continuously remove digits from the left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797,
            797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, 3.</p>

            <p>Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right
            and right to left.</p>

            <p class="note">NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.</p>
