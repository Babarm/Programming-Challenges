        <!-- Problem Description -->
        <div class="description">
            <p>Using <a style="color: #777" href="./assets/data/022.txt"
                target="_blank">names.txt</a>, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first
            names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical
            value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to
            obtain a name score.</p>

            <p>For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3
            + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938<sup>th</sup> name in the list. So, COLIN would
            obtain a score of 938 &#21; 53 = 49714.</p>

            <p>What is the total of all the name scores in the file?</p>
