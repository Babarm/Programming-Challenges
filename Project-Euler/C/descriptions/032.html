        <!-- Problem Description -->
        <div class="description">
            <p>We shall say that an <var>n</var>-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all
            the digits 1 to <var>n</var> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1
            through 5 pandigital.</p>

            <p>The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 &#215; 186 = 7254, containing
            multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>

            <p>Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be
            written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>

            <p class="note">HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
            only include it once in your sum.</p>
