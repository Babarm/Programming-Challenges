        <!-- Problem Description -->
        <div class="description">
            <p>By replacing the 1<sup>st</sup> digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six
            of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.</p>

            <p>By replacing the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> digits of 56**3 with the same
            digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten
            generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and
            56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime
            with this property.</p>

            <p>Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily
            adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.</p>
