# Lists, Strings
If your language of choice doesn't have a built-in list and/or string type (e.g. if you use C), these exercises should be 
solvable for arrays. However, some solutions are very different between an array-based list (like 
<span style="font-family:Consolas;">C++'s vector</span>) and a pointer based list (like 
<span style="font-family:Consolas;">C++'s list</span>), at least if you care about the efficiency of your code. So you 
might want to either find a library, or investigate how to implement your own linked list if your language doesn't have 
it.
1. Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.
2. Write a function that reverses a list, preferably in place.
3. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.
4. Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.
5. Write a function that computes the running total of a list.
6. Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
7. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a <b>for-loop</b>, a <b>while-loop</b> 
and <b>recursion</b>. (Subject to availability of these constructs in your language of choice.)
