Challenge #2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
====================================

Each new term in the Fibonacci Sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms are:

{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...}

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million (4,000,000 | 4e6), find the sum of the even valued terms.
